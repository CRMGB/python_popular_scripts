# python_popular_scripts

Just some python practices which I will take into account efficiency timing each execution

I used Jupiter notebooks with anaconda in ubuntu 20.04

Resources used:
	- pip install functools
	- pip install timeit
	- pip install fastprogress
	- pip install typeguard
	- pip install typecheck
	- pip install perfplot
